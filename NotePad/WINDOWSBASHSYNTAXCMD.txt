pushd %~dp0 ##you could also use ''pushd %~dp0'' to switch drive and folder


Save the current directory on a stack and change to %~dp0 which is the drive-and-path of the "0'th" command-line parameter (which is the command itself) so the destination path to be set is the
drive/path of the batch file to be executed.




popd 
  %~dp0
  
The popd command changes the current directory to the directory that was most recently stored by the pushd command. 
Every time you use the pushd command, a single directory is stored for your use. 
However, you can store multiple directories by using the pushd command multiple times.

To return to the original path, you need a popd
